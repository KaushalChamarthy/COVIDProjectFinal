# COVIDProjectFinal
Collects health/user data and determines optimal hospital to visit, if needed.

We will be collecting Heart rate and Oxygen levels from the Samsung Health app, as a csv file. Other collected data includes breathing rate, body temperature, and age/gender (used as baselines).

Then, other conditions will be checked, creating a number for the patient based on the severity of their symptoms, which will be compared to a threshold to determine whether the patient should go to the hospital.

If the system deems it necesary, then the user's address and range will be asked to create an optimized list of hospitals. Else, a message will appear to tell the user their options and email a doctor, if needed.

This application is by no means approved by the CDC, WHO, or any other health organization. Its purpose is to serve as a framework for other applications to build off of.
